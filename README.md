# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker Project
# Project Description
This project analyzes global & East Africa COVID-19 data to uncover patterns in infections, deaths, vaccination progress, and socioeconomic factors. It combines visualizations, statistical summaries, and correlation analysis to explore disparities in pandemic outcomes across countries. The goal is to inform public health strategies and policy interventions by highlighting key trends and relationships.

# Objectives
Visualize the global distribution of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination efforts.
Investigate how demographic (e.g., age structure, population density) and socioeconomic factors (e.g., GDP per capita) influenced pandemic outcomes.
Provide actionable recommendations for improving healthcare preparedness and equity in future crises.
Tools and Libraries
Python: Primary programming language.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Plotly/Matplotlib/Seaborn: Interactive and static visualizations.
Python: Development environment for code and analysis.
